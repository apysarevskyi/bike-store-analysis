# Bike Store Analysis (SQL, Power BI)

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a bike store's sales data, focusing on identifying top-performing stores, customer insights, and product trends. The dataset used for this analysis can be found here: [Kaggle - Bike Store Sample Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database/data).

## Key aspects of this project include:

* Analyzing store performance based on total revenue and customer lifetime value.
* Investigating product popularity by category and model.
* Visualizing monthly sales trends and highlighting unusual fluctuations.
* Segmenting customers to identify high-value buyers and assess customer loyalty.
